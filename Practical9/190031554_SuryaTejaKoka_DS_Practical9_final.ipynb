    "1. What is probability?\n",
    "A) Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning numerical descriptions of how likely an event is to occur, \n",
    "or how likely it is that a proposition is true. \n",

    "3. What is joint probability\n",
    "A) Joint probability is a statistical measure that calculates the likelihood of two events occurring together and at the same point in time. \n",
    "Joint probability is the probability of event Y occurring at the same time that event X occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is conditional probability\n",
    "A) Conditional probability is the probability of one event occurring with some relationship to one or more other events. \n",
    "For example: Event A is that it is raining outside, and it has a 0.3 (30%) chance of raining today. \n",
    "Event B is that you will need to go outside, and that has a probability of 0.5 (50%)\n",
